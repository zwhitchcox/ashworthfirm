        <h2>Conservatorship</h2>
        <p>
        Caring for an aging family member is often a very difficult and expensive process. In some cases,
        it becomes necessary to take legal steps to protect the safety and security of your loved one from
        physical harm, the threat of instability and great financial loss. When a spouse or parent is
        suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, it can be very difficult to provide the kind of
        care and comfort they need, and the toll it takes on your family can be devastating. If you must
        take legal action, you need an experienced legal team protecting your family.
        </p><p>

        you with the legal resources you need to properly care for your aging family members. Our

        into new commercial office or retail space is an exciting venture. However, commercial leases
        are highly complex legal agreements that require the assistance of an experienced attorney in
        several  different  areas  of  the  law.  Successfully  and  strategically  negotiating  a
        commercial  lease  could  be  a significant factor in the overall success and longevity
        of your business. “Form Contracts” that are not customized to each specific client’s situation
        are dangerous and can be financially devastating if misused. Our attorneys take a methodical
        approach  to  lease  negotiations  in  order  to  protect  our  client’s  interests  and  also
        potentially  inject financial value into the transaction.
        </p><p>
        Most commercial leases contain industry specific provisions and aggressive  financial
        obligations. Our attorneys have  practical  experience  and  backgrounds  in  various
        businesses  that  add  a  valuable  strategic  element  to  the negotiation process.
        Negotiating specific terms such as HVAC repairs and replacement, common area maintenancefees,
        tenant  improvement  allowances,  options  to  extend, rights  of  first  refusal,
        and  other  warranties  and representations can be the difference your business needs to
        succeed. These specific lease terms equate to dollars and cents. Our goal is to strategically
        structure your lease with such precision that you are in the best legal position possible,
        which in turn, affects your bottom line. When our clients succeed, we succeed. Call one of
        our skilled attorneys today to represent and assist you through the commercial lease process.
